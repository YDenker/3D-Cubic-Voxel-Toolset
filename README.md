# 3D-Cubic-Voxel-Toolset
This will be an application to create 3D Object in a Voxel style using cubic shapes.
If you are familiar with creating 3D Assets in any other software (e.g. Blender) this will be the "low budged"-version made by myself with very limited capabilities.
The only reason i am creating this is to greatly simplify the process for cubic voxel assets.

This is a very spontanious project with only a rough plan in mind. All questions you have after reading the description will probably not be answered by me. Not because i'm an ignorant prick, but because i do not know myself. I will figure this out along the way.

Warning! This is generally not a good design philosophy, especially if you are working in a team. Having a plan and your whole project thought out is most likely the key to success! You have been warned :)!
